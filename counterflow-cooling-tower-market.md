<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Counterflow Cooling Tower Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Type</li><li>Closed Type</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Counterflow cooling towers are classified into three main types - Open Type, Closed Type, and Others. Open Type cooling towers use ambient air to cool the water flowing through the tower, with direct contact between the air and water. Closed Type cooling towers, on the other hand, use a heat exchanger to cool the water, preventing direct contact with the air. The Others category includes hybrid cooling towers and evaporative condensers that combine features of both Open and Closed Type cooling towers.</p></p>
